1. Gross Revenue
2. Quantity of Deliveries
3. Weight (tons)
4. Goods Value
5. Total Costs
6. Cost per Kilometer
7. Cost per Ton
8. Quantity of Trucks Used
9. Fixed Costs & Percentage
10. Variable Costs
11. Daily Costs
12. Financial Results
13. Kilometers Travelled
14. ATP (Average Track Price)
15. Gross Margin Percentage (GM%)
